# “Robot or Not” — Sample code files for [<cite>Responsive Web Design</cite>](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)

Hello there, lovely reader!

This is the repository for the “ROBOT…OR NOT?” demo site ([http://responsivewebdesign.com/robot/](http://responsivewebdesign.com/robot/)), an example site used in [Ethan Marcotte](http://ethanmarcotte.com/)’s <cite>[Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design)</cite>. Please do come in, and poke around.

As you do, though, there are two things I'd ask you keep in mind:

1. This stylesheet reflects the structure of the book: starting from a desktop-centric layout, and using media queries to size it up *and* down from that point. As I say in Chapter 5 of the book, the more responsible, *accessible* approach would be to start from a linear, small screen-friendly layout, and use `min-width` queries to scale *up* from that point.
2. Since this is a _demo_ site, there are a number of production-ready optimizations that haven’t been made. (Concatenated files, conditionally loaded JavaScript, and so on.)

So: come on in, poke around, and have a look around.

Thanks so much for reading my book!
